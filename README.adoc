= CloudBees action: Register build artifacts

Use this action to register one or more artifact versions in CloudBees Unify from a workflow run.
The action accepts a JSON array of artifact metadata objects, allowing you to register multiple artifacts in a single run.

:tip-caption: :bulb:
TIP: When registering just one artifact version, you can use link:https://github.com/cloudbees-io/register-build-artifact[register-build-artifact] as an alternative to this action.

[NOTE]
====
Do not include the `register-build-artifacts` action for the same artifact version with any of the following actions, as the resulting run would register duplicate artifact entries to CloudBees Unify.

[#footnote]
^[1]^ By default, this action associates the artifact version with the code commit associated with the workflow run in the workflow's repository/branch.
If a different commit/repository/branch has been checked out for building the artifact, specify that commit ID instead. If you do not want to associate a commit with this artifact version, specify an empty commit.
